# The Temp LCD Web Reporter
This project use the DHT11 Temperature / Humidity sensor to collect readings and transfer them
to a Thingspeak webpage for graphing.  Long term focus of the project will be to send a SMS or Email
when temperature drops below a threshold. This may then trigger additional actions like activating 
Smart switch to turn on heaters.
